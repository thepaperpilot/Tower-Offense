Opening Cutscene (after clicking start?)
In a strange forest at the break of daylight, the animals were happy and all was alright. === Fox walks in on the left smiling.
Yet on a walk through a grassy green glade, a curious animal became quite afraid! === The fox looks concerned.
Where once was the road to the watering spot, now stands walls of stone, a path there is not. === The fox: Shocked.  Tower walks in stage right.
The top of these towers held creatures of stone, who watched the approach with rocks nearly thrown. === Fox Statue walks in: glaring.
“But where will we drink?” the critter exclaimed.  “How could you come and destroy this terrain!” === FOX: Saddened, speaking.
With nothing received but bashes near deathly, the critter ran home with speed quite expressly. === The statue chases the Fox off the left side: angry. Fox: scared.
But not before muttering a terrible promise, “I warn you, you demons, that I am quite honest.” === The fox comes back on stage right, angry, turns around at the left side of the screen.
“When I next appear, prepare your defense, for I will return with a Tower Offense!” === Fox: Angry, looking right from stage left.  Statue Fox, angrily walks in from stage right and watches.
 ===The actors walk off stage, level start.

 
Level 1 click start:
As the critter had said, when the next day arose, it returned with its friends and a plan to bulldoze. === Fox, Wolf, Bear walk in screen left: .  Tower enters screen right. <> Faces: Fox=4; Wolf=8; Bear=0; Tower=0;
They build their burrows and work all their farms, prepared to battle and to do some harm. === All critters walk around stage left to represent work.  Wolf ends right of other critters on stage left. <> Face changes: None.
“We’ve all come to drink and we will not find stall.  We’ll huff through your towers and blow down your wall!” === Wolf speaks. <> Face Changes: None.
LEVEL 1 HAPPENS
The battle was bloody and all were quite shaken, but now they knew nothing from them could be taken. === Bear, Wolf, Rabbit, Fox enter stage left. <> Faces: Fox=1; Wolf=2; Rabbit=0; Bear=1;
“I’m surprised we could do it, burst through that wall?  Perhaps we are not all that weak after all.” === All turn to Bear. Bear speaks to other critters. <> Face Changes: Bear=11;
“Are we sure that we’re safe?  Those stones really hurt.”  A small critter added while staying alert. === All turn to Rabbit. Rabbit speaks to other critters, looking around. <> FCs: Rabbit=7;
“We’ve passed through the worst, we mustn’t look back.  Lucky they don’t know we’re best in a pack.” === All turn to Wolf.  Wolf speaks to other critters.  Exit stage right. <> FCs: Wolf=1; Rabbit=1; Bear=1;

 
Level 2 click start:
“Our beloved spring is just over that hill!”  Instead what they saw haunts the lot of them still. === Fox, Bear, Wolf enter stage left: excited.
“Our spring, it’s gone!” the critters all cried, “they filled it with stones ‘til it totally dried!” === Fox, Bear, Wolf: shocked.  
“How could this be?  It’s all too insane!  There’s no way that we could let one stone remain!”
“You’ve taken our water!” a fox thus exclaimed, “So we will not stop until you all are maimed!”
LEVEL 2 HAPPENS
The next day passed quickly, they make the spring clean, all tearing up stone just to fill each canteen. 
Their thirst fully quenched, they turned back around, prouder of all of the skills that they’ve found.
“Somehow those towers were extra destructive.  No wonder they build them to be so obstructive.”
“Making it through felt really climactic.  Thank goodness those turrets are totally static.”


Level 3 click start:
As the critters reverse, they start to relax, “We’ve done it!” but that was quite far from exact.
For on their return, the towers were gone.  The critters were worried but had to press on.
The army, excited by their success, quickly forgot about all their distress.
Until, that is, they spotted their dens, covered in towers attacking their friends!
“How could this happen?  What can we do?  The towers can walk and attack our homes too!”
“We finish them off,” a critter responds, “for freedom from towers is our one true cause!”
LEVEL 3 HAPPENS
The critters made battle for the longest hours, until they had managed to destroy the towers.
And even destroy the statues that live, the beings the critters just could not forgive.
“We’re finally free of these terrible towers.  Our water is free and we’ve gained some new powers.”
“We must not forget all this strength that we’ve gained, for if we forget then we may well be slain.”
“Perhaps we will last when we’re next outdone, now we should party, offense has won.”
For you who have helped, you’ve done quite a lot, perhaps it is worth giving just one more shot!
Game Over
